# Attendance-system-using-face-recognition

This project is a web-based application demonstrating the use of facial recognition for marking attendance of students built as a part of a mentee challange under [Microsoft Engage-2022](https://acehacker.com/microsoft/engage2022/index.html). It is a web application that can be used by the institue to manage attendance of its students.
